# Privacy Policy

Effective Date: 28/12/2025

Recipedia respects your privacy.

This Privacy Policy explains how our app uses permissions, displays advertising, and what information it handles.

## Information Collection and Use

Your recipe data is stored locally on your device and is never transmitted to our servers.

However, our app displays advertisements through Google AdMob, which may collect certain information as described below.

## Advertising

Our app uses Google AdMob to display banner advertisements. AdMob may collect and use data to provide personalized ads,
including:

* Device identifiers (advertising ID)
* IP address
* General location (country/region level)
* App usage data

**For users in the European Union (EU)**: Before displaying personalized ads, we will ask for your consent through a
GDPR-compliant consent dialog. You can choose to:

* Accept personalized ads
* Receive only non-personalized ads

You can manage your ad preferences at any time through your device settings.

For more information about how Google uses data, please
see [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)
and [How Google uses data when you use our partners' sites or apps](https://policies.google.com/technologies/partner-sites).

## Permissions Used

Our app requests the following permissions solely for essential functionality:

* android.permission.CAMERA: Used to access the device camera for (e.g., scanning, taking photos, etc.). No images are
  uploaded or stored externally.
* android.permission.INTERNET: Required only for basic app functionality such as accessing online documentation or
  resources. No personal data is
  transmitted.
* android.permission.READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE and android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE: Used to let the app read and
  write files locally on the device when necessary (e.g., saving or loading photos). The app never uploads these files
  anywhere.
* android.permission.SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW: Allows the app to display overlays or floating elements, used only for
  enhancing user experience.
* android.permission.VIBRATE: Enables device vibration for user feedback or notifications.

None of these permissions are used to collect personal data.

## Data Security

Because no data is transmitted, no external data storage occurs.

All processing happens on the device, and users maintain full control of their data.

## Children’s Privacy

Our app does not target children specifically, and it does not collect any personal information from anyone, including
children under 13.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy if the app’s behavior changes.
Any new version will be published on this page.
